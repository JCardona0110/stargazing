Stargazer Society APOD is a picture of the day generator utilizing the NASA APOD API  to show users a picture or video of what they saw that day in history.

My learning was focused on making a clean background that was simple and focused on the awe inspiring photos and videos being served from the NASA API. I also wanted to ensure that it was functional on all device sizes.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project I would spend more time giving it a more unique look along with a button to go back and choose another date rather than having to refresh each time.
I would also like to add a sharing functionality to share the content on social media as well. I would also like to go back and refactor the SASS to make it more efficient.

## Lessons Learned:

Spend more time learning design and all the possibilities that are available in CSS to ensure applications look as crisp and beautiful as you want them to be.
